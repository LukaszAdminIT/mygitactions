  Migrating Dynamic GitLab CI Stages to GitHub Actions
    To convert your dynamic GitLab CI pipeline (which uses Jinja templating to generate jobs and stages from a nested dictionary) into GitHub Actions, you need to understand the differences in how each system handles dynamic job generation and matrix strategies.
    
    Key Differences
  GitLab CI: Supports dynamic job and stage generation using Jinja templating and variables.

  GitHub Actions: Does not support dynamic job generation via templating in YAML. Instead, it uses the matrix strategy to generate multiple job runs from combinations of variables.
    
    Recommended Approach in GitHub Actions
    1. Use a Matrix Strategy
    You can define a matrix of variables (e.g., dev_type, node_type, host_ip_address, service_name) to generate jobs for each combination. This is the closest equivalent to your Jinja loop logic.
    
    Example Matrix Definition
    text
  jobs:
    deploy:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      strategy:
        matrix:
          dev_type: [dev, prod]
          node_type: [node1, node2]
          host_ip_address: [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2]
          service_name: [serviceA, serviceB]
      steps:
        - name: Print environment
          run: printenv
        # ... (other steps as below)
    You can generate the matrix dynamically using a script or by maintaining a JSON/YAML file with all combinations.
    
    2. Job Steps for SSH and Docker Compose
    Each job in the matrix can run the deployment steps using SSH and Docker Compose, similar to your GitLab script. Use secrets for sensitive data like SSH keys.
    
    Example Steps
    text
  steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up SSH key
      run: |
        echo "${{ secrets.ID_RSA }}" > id_rsa
        chmod 400 id_rsa

    - name: Create remote directory
      run: |
        ssh -i id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ matrix.host_ip_address }} \
          "mkdir -p ${{ matrix.service_name }}_${{ matrix.node_type }}_${{ env.CANARY_TYPE }}"

    - name: Copy docker-compose and env
      run: |
        scp -i id_rsa docker-compose.yml .env ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ matrix.host_ip_address }}:${{ matrix.service_name }}_${{ matrix.node_type }}_${{ env.CANARY_TYPE }}

    - name: Set permissions
      run: |
        ssh -i id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ matrix.host_ip_address }} \
          "chmod -R 770 ${{ matrix.service_name }}_${{ matrix.node_type }}_${{ env.CANARY_TYPE }}"

    - name: Pull Docker image
      run: |
        ssh -i id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ matrix.host_ip_address }} \
          "cd ${{ matrix.service_name }}_${{ matrix.node_type }}_${{ env.CANARY_TYPE }} && source ./.env && docker pull ${REGISTRY}/${GROUP}/${APPLICATION}:${APPLICATION_VERSION}"

    - name: Restart Docker Compose
      run: |
        ssh -i id_rsa -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SERVER_USER }}@${{ matrix.host_ip_address }} \
          "cd ${{ matrix.service_name }}_${{ matrix.node_type }}_${{ env.CANARY_TYPE }} && docker compose down && docker compose up -d"
    3. Manual Triggers and Allow Failure
  Manual Triggers: Use workflow_dispatch to allow manual runs.

  Allow Failure: Use continue-on-error: true in steps or jobs.
    
    Example
    text
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:

  jobs:
    deploy:
      # ... (matrix and steps as above)
      continue-on-error: true
    4. Organizing the Workflow
    Place your workflow YAML in .github/workflows/.
    
    Use GitHub secrets for sensitive variables.
    
    If your matrix is very large or needs to be generated from a data structure, consider generating the matrix JSON in a prior step or using a reusable workflow.
    
    Limitations and Tips
  No direct Jinja templating: All job definitions must be static or generated via matrix.

  Matrix size: GitHub Actions supports up to 256 jobs per matrix.

  Dynamic matrix: For highly dynamic scenarios, generate the matrix in a prior step and pass it as an output to a reusable workflow.

  Summary:
    You must replace your Jinja-based dynamic job generation with a matrix strategy in GitHub Actions, mapping your variables (dev_type, node_type, host_ip_address, service_name) to matrix entries. Each job will then run the deployment steps using SSH and Docker Compose, with manual triggers and error handling as needed.
